       This GWAS pipeline performs association mapping using the EMMAX software, a mixed model accounting for the sample structure. In addition to the computational efficiency obtained by EMMA algorithm, EMMAX takes advantage of the fact that each loci explains only a small fraction of complex traits, which allows us to avoid repetitive variance component estimation procedure, resulting in a significant amount of increase in computational time of association mapping using mixed model.
       EMMAX is a linear mixed model (LMM) to perform GWAS, correcting by a wide range of sample structures (which encompasses population stratification and hidden relatedness). To this end, it uses an internally calculated kinship matrix as a random effect, and population structure externally calculated as a fixed effect.
       This is the second step of the workflow, which transforms the SNP file from .ped format to a .tped format, suitable to be used in EMMAX.
       This tool requires a .ped file as input file, containing the SNPs

       *PLINK* program is used to perform this step.
